## Equation Balance

The [article by Pickup and Kellstedt](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/abs/balance-as-a-preestimation-test-for-time-series-analysis/41D4D675F25E087A142CB04F27634CC1) forms the basis for summary remarks on time series and a useful transition into the study of multiple time series formally for week two.

The lingering issue that does not get adequate treatment owing to time is fractional integration methods.  Indeed, [the article by Lebo and Grant (2016) summarising the issues in the 2016 special issue is worth digesting.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/abs/equation-balance-and-dynamic-political-modeling/A6EBC3D683502460B9D7C1BE2B64C5F4)

## A Note on ARCH and GARCH

ARCH and GARCH Models 

- Models of the conditional volatility (variance) in the errors
- Widely used in financial econometrics with volatility in an assets being taken as an indicator of risk

### ARCH Model of order $q$

$$
e_t = \sigma_t Z_t
$$
$Z_t$ = white noise
$\sigma_t$ = standard deviation

$$
\sigma^{2}_t = a_0 + a_1e^{2}_{t-1} + \ldots + a_{q}e^{2}_{t-q}
$$

### GARCH Model

- $p$ is order of the GARCH terms $\sigma^2$

- $q$ is order of ARCH terms $e^2$

$$\sigma^2_{t} = w + \underbrace{\Sigma_{i=1}^{q} a_i e^{2}_{t-i}}_{(ARCH components)} + \underbrace{\Sigma_{i=1}^{p} B_i \sigma^{2}_{t-i}}_{(GARCH components)}
$$
