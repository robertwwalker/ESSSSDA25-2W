## The I() construct

`?formula` gives you insights into the way to structure generic formula objects in R.  The `I()` construct is a consistent and clear way in R's foundations to specify functional operations on variables.

## R and GMM

There are a number of packages for estimating GMM models in R.  `pgmm` does many of the most basic models, though Stata is the industry leader in this.  That said, there is a relatively new and highly customizable package for this: `pdynmc` which is [described here in a pdf vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pdynmc/vignettes/pdynmc-intro.pdf).  The package is rather new; the paper is forthcoming.
